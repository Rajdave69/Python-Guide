# Floats

A float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

```python
x = 5.5
```
Here, the variable `x` is a float. To declare a float, you can just assign a number with a decimal point to a variable without quotes.

## Float Methods

Floats are objects, and like all objects they have methods. Methods are functions that are built into objects.

These are some of the most common float methods:

```python
x = 5.5
print(x.as_integer_ratio()) # (11, 2)
print(x.is_integer()) # False
print(x.is_float()) # True
```

Floats are just like integers, except they can contain decimals.
