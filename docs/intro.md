# Introduction

Hello and Welcome to my Python Tutorial. This tutorial is for beginners who want to learn Python from scratch. This tutorial will teach you basic Python programming.

Keep in mind that this will not give you any real-world practice, but it will give you a good understanding of the Python programming language's theory and syntax.

## Getting Started

You can choose to get an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
If you're choosing to install an IDE, you will need to install the Python interpreter. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

If you don't want to download an IDE. You can use [VS Code Online](https://vscode.dev) or a online Python interpreter like [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3).

### What you'll need
